# recovery_bruteforcer
tries to guess recovery phrases of lost crypto wallets so you can collect the coins if you find one

feel free to replace the word list with the word list of your choice, but you need one for the code to work and it must be named the same

leave the phrases file empty (unless you find a valid phrase, that is where it will be saved)
